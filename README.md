# Sales-Prediction

## Project Overview <br>
This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict car prices based on various features such as customer income, age, and credit score. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and used to train a deep learning regression model.

Key Steps in the Project:
- Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, feature scaling, and preparing input-output variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing relationships between variables using matplotlib and seaborn.
- ANN Model Implementation – Designing a multi-layer neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Model Training & Evaluation – Optimizing the model with different hyperparameters and assessing performance.
- Predictions & Insights – Using the trained model to make car price predictions based on new data.

This project demonstrates the power of deep learning in regression tasks and how ANN models can be applied in real-world price estimation problems.
